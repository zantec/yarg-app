## Usage

> Solve riddles and hunt for buried treasure! Public, procedurally generated riddles and treasures are updated daily so new adventures always await. Choose one near you and see if you can puzzle out its mysterious directions and find the buried treasure.

>Bury your own treasure and write your own riddle! Make your directions as clear or vexing as you like then leave your riddle in a public location for others to find.

> Use your phone's camera to hunt for the X! If you think you've succesfully navigated the riddle's mysteries open up the AR view and look around for the X that marks the spot. Dig away and claim your booty!
